Fix the scoping rules in tokenize.go so that they don't rely on OTHER scopes, only the one's that they actually should rely on. i.e.
something
    something
    something
something
  something
  something
  something #this indent level has just as much of a right to be one level in from root as that other one does :). Current implementation doesn't like this one very much though

Better yet, use an INDENT token rather than spaces to show indentations, and use some for of relative indenting (perhaps?)

Figure out why the INT and FLOAT regexp's don't work and fix them so that everything isn't just a STRING

Have a different token on each line, like in the example
